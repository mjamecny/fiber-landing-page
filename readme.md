# Fiber landing page

Landing page for startup Fiber built with React and styled-components. This is a one of challenges from Codewell coding platform. I've built this page from scratch using starter files from Codewell.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - client-side routing
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - for styles
